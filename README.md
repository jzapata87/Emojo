# Emojo App

This is a project intended to be used as a learning tool.  Over time as new tech is release I plan on making new versions (by forking) to this with new tech.
I use instagrams basic layout because I felt it best represented what I wanted to do.

## Installation
This is a react-native project, I will ask you to please refer those resources in order to get the project running on your machine.
I did not use expo.  I used xcode and android studio to run the simulator/emulators.

## Usage example
I will post a link to a video of me using the app or I will just use screenshots.
